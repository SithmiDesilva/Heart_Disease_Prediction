## 📌 Project Overview
**SmartCardia** is an advanced heart disease risk prediction system that leverages machine learning to estimate the likelihood of heart disease in patients. It processes key health indicators such as age, cholesterol, ECG results, and blood pressure, then outputs a real-time risk assessment through an interactive web interface.

---

## 🎯 What This Project Does
This project builds a predictive model to:
- Identify individuals at high risk of heart disease.
- Provide probability-based interpretations of risk.
- Support early intervention decisions by clinicians.

---

## 🤔 Why This Matters
Cardiovascular disease remains the **leading cause of death globally**. Early prediction enables:
- 🏥 Timely clinical intervention
- 📈 Data-driven diagnosis and treatment planning
- 💡 Empowerment of patients with personalized risk insights

---

## ✨ Features
- 📊 Structured dataset with patient health metrics
- 🧠 Machine Learning: Logistic Regression & Random Forest
- 📈 Visual analysis using plots and correlation heatmaps
- 🖥️ Real-time predictions via Streamlit web app
- 📊 Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC Curve, Confusion Matrix

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Demographics**: Age, Gender
