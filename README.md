## 📌 Project Overview
SmartCardia is an advanced **heart disease risk prediction system** that leverages machine learning algorithms to assess an individual's likelihood of developing heart disease based on key health indicators. The system processes patient data and provides predictive insights to aid early detection and prevention.

## ✨ Features
- 📊 **Dataset:** Uses structured medical data including age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and more.
- 🏆 **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- 🏥 **Health Metrics Analysis:** Uses patient data to identify potential heart disease risks.
- 📈 **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve.
- 🖥️ **Web Application:**  Deploy using  Streamlit for real-time predictions.

## 📂 Dataset
The system uses a dataset with health metrics such as:
- **Age, Gender**
- **Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Levels**
- **Heart Rate, Diabetes History**
- **Exercise-induced Angina, ECG Results**



## 📊 Results
- The model provides accurate predictions of heart disease risks.
- Evaluation includes **Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Precision-Recall Analysis**.

## 📉 Visualizations
- **Histograms** to analyze the feature distributions
- **Boxplots** to analyze the outliers
- **Correlation Heatmap** to analyze feature importance

## 🔧 Future Enhancements
- Improve model performance with deep learning.
- Integrate real-time wearable device data for continuous monitoring.
